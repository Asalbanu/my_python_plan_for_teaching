The first step to learn Programming language is to begin what we should use to code in Python.
Well, there many environments to code for programmers today. In Python, you can use the following environments:
- Pycharm. download: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows 
- google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/ 
- anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution 
- cpython: https://github.com/python/cpython 
- ironpython: https://ironpython.net/ 
- pypy: https://www.pypy.org/ 
- jython: https://www.jython.org/ 

And if you google, you can find the other kind of coding environments on Python.
If you are starting to learn programming language and Python is your first language that you are learning then I will suggest you to start learning from C or C++ language.
Then why?
Python language has many benefits:
- user-friendly: easy to learn and to code
- involves many spheres: backend(django, flask, etc), Telegram, API, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, etc
- high level language (one of the most used language)
However, as this language is easy to learn, you can understand easily to the syntax of this programming language and Python is indicated to use the methods and functions.
Therefore, if you want to learn deeply about Data Structures and Algorithms, then start learning from C and C++ basics.
It is more helpful to understand Algorithms deeply.
